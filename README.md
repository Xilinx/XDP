XRT Debug/Profile
==============

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The XRT Debug/Profile libraries are designed to be built and used in
conjunction with XRT and not as a standalone tool.  This set of loadable
modules implement debug/profiling functionality on host code, PL constructs,
and AIE components.

User controls are through the xrt.ini file.  Support exists for both PCIe
based platforms and embedded platforms.
